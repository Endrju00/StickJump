## General info
StickJump - a 2D game for mobile devices, created using Python language and the Kivy library using OpenGL to generate graphics and also enabling the launch of applications on multiple platforms, incl. Windows, Android, iOS. The hero's animations were created using the Pivot animator software. The game is equipped with collision detection between Stickman and obstacles and a score counter. The player has 2 lives, loses one when he leaves the user's screen by contact with an obstacle. After losing lives, user will see a summary of the run and the number of coins obtained (1000 points = 1 coin). Player can purchase character skins available in the store. The control consists in touching the left and right side of the screen - holding the left side causes a slide, touching the right one once causes a jump, and two times - a double jump (if you hold the right side while jumping, the hero will crumple). During the game, we can pause it (bottom left corner) and mute the soundtrack (bottom right corner).
